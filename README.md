[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AngryLawyer/rust-apl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AngryLawyer/rust-apl)

Experimental APL interpreter in Rust. LGPL 3.0 License.

Aiming for compatibility with code used with Dyalog's implementation.

Definitely not ready for actual use. You have been warned.
